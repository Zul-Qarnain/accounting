_"First of all, a burqa isn’t some divine 'Deen measurement scale.' Second, where did this '90%' statistic come from—your own undercover research? And if you're so religious, shouldn’t you be more concerned about backbiting (gheebah) and slander (buhtan) instead of keeping track of who's dating who?"_

*"Coming from a girl who wears Burqa in the university: Your post honestly didn't surprise me as much because we girls are so used to these BS assumptions and judgements at this point. It’s understandable you might be one of those several clout chasers but for once, I’m going to give you the attention you so desperately seek for.

In no shape or form are we perfect Muslims, but if someone covers herself up, that's her attempt towards devotion to Allah (SWT). But you know what’s the sign of a poor mentality? Posting these things in the holy month of Ramadan.

You might have missed the part in HUM103 which defines that ethics and morality aren’t necessarily correlated to religion. So a Hijabi/Niqabi girl can maintain her **porda**, “date” a guy who isn’t nearly as misogynistic as this post, and live happily ever after.

Learn to suck it up."*
